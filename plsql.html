<h2><strong>What is PL/SQL?</strong></h2>
<p>PL/SQL is a block structured language that enables developers to combine the power of SQL with procedural statements.All the statements of a block are passed to oracle engine all at once which increases processing speed and decreases the traffic.</p>
<h2><strong>Basics of PL/SQL</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language extensions to the Structured Query Language (SQL)</li>
  <li>PL/SQL is a combination of SQL along with the procedural features of programming languages.</li>
  <li>Oracle uses a PL/SQL engine to processes the PL/SQL statements.</li>
  <li>PL/SQL includes procedural language elements like conditions and loops. It allows declaration of constants and variables, procedures and functions, types and variable of those types and triggers.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Features of PL/SQL</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>PL/SQL is basically a procedural language, which provides the functionality of decision making, iteration and many more features of procedural programming languages.</li>
<li>PL/SQL can execute a number of queries in one block using single command.</li>
<li>One can create a PL/SQL unit such as procedures, functions, packages, triggers, and types, which are stored in the database for reuse by applications.</li>
<li>PL/SQL provides a feature to handle the exception which occurs in PL/SQL block known as exception handling block.</li>
<li>Applications written in PL/SQL are portable to computer hardware or operating system where Oracle is operational.</li>
<li>PL/SQL Offers extensive error checking.</li>
</ul>
